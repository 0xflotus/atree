Christmas Tree
===============

I found animated Christmas tree on reddit:

Was curious to make it in js. This is work in progress. Current results are here: [Merry Christmas!](http://anvaka.github.io/atree/)

There are small things which are not perfect:

* I do not properly mimic spiral's curvature at the top of the tree
* Colors need to change more gradually, depending on Z coordinate
* Shadows are not accurate
